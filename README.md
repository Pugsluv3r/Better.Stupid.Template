# ii's Stupid Template
ii's Stupid Template is a mod menu template for Gorilla Tag with custom categories and the maximum amount of customization possible. This template is meant for more advanced users, so if you're a new menu creator, this could be difficult for you.

I have modified this template to be more user-friendly and easier to understand, but it still requires some knowledge of C# and Unity(recomended). If you're new to modding or programming, It can be difficult to understand

## Do I need permission to use this?
No, this template is free and public for anyone to use. You are welcome to utilize it for your projects, modify it to suit your needs, and share it with others. We believe in a collaborative and open community where resources are accessible to all.
